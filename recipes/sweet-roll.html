        in this skeeverhole of a city..."</em> -Dagny</h3>
    <p>Sweetrolls, sometimes spelled as sweet rolls, 
        are a tasty confectionary food. They are pastries 
        with a light brown sweetbread as the lower 
        part, with icing covering the top. Sweetrolls
         are typically made from milk, flour, butter, 
         eggs, and salt, but we added sugar to this version
        so as to make it more palatable.
